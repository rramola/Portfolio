        <div class="about_me_description">
          <p>I'm an apprentice software developer at Base Camp Coding Academy with a lifelong passion for technology. My journey into the world of coding began in the eighth 
            grade when I was introduced to web development through Neopets and Myspace. This early exposure sparked my 
            curiosity and led me to explore game design and web design programs in high school, where I learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Visual Basic, and 3D modeling.<br></p>
          <p>In addition to my technical background, I have a strong foundation in sales and automotive repair, with a specialization in electrical diagnostics and repair. 
            These experiences have honed my problem-solving skills and taught me the value of attention to detail and perseverance.<br></p>
          <p>I'm excited to continue learning and growing in the field of software development, leveraging my diverse skill set to create innovative solutions. 
            I'm particularly interested in exploring the intersection of technology and human interaction, and I'm eager to contribute to projects that make a positive impact.<br></p>
          <p>Outside of work, I enjoy hobbies such as skateboarding and scuba diving, attending events and overcoming challenges, whether it's a problem with a vehicle I am workng on or debugging a 
            complex piece of code. 
            I'm always looking for new opportunities to expand my knowledge and make meaningful contributions. Let's connect and collaborate on something amazing!
