From a very young age I have had a passion for technology and
computers. Eighth grade was when I really found my interest in
software development. There was a web based game called Neopets that
became very popular. In this game, as your progressed you could open
as shop to sell items you collected while adventuring with your pets.
A feature was implemented so you could customize your store front
using a limited amount of HTML and CSS. I would spend hours reading
and researching ways to make my shop stand out. At one point I even
made a few custom graphics to use as a background image for my shop.
As I got older, I was eventually allowed to create a Myspace page.
This was another cool feature that myspace implemented. With exposure
to these websites and the limited web development you could do, the
flame was ignited for what would be my future career dream. As I
entered High School, as a result of my previous exposure to web design
I was enrolled into the game design and web design programs. The game
design class was very interesting, we learned the basics of 3d
modeling and visual basic. I became the go to person for fixing my
friends computers and have since been in pursuit of entering this
career field.
